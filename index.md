# Bastion of Shadows - a Star Wars-inspired browser game

Bastion of Shadows is a free-to-play, open source game inspired by Star Wars and table-top RPGs. It's currently under construction, so there's nothing to play yet, but you can provide suggestions or feedback at the [Bastion of Shadows documentation GitHub repository](https://github.com/bastion-of-shadows/docs).

## Help wanted

Bastion of Shadows is currently looking for designers, developers, and storytellers! A game like this isn't going to build itself, and it's a lot for one person to handle alone.

This is an open source game with no pay model and no ads, so our developers work on a volunteer basis. Maybe you want another portfolio piece. Maybe you're a new developer and you want some team experience. Whatever the case, we'd love to hear from you by sending us an email at [bastionofshadows@gmail.com](mailto:bastionofshadows@gmail.com) and telling us what you'd like to contribute.

There's no pay for the work now, but if the game generates revenue, 70% of the net profit will be disbursed fairly among active contributors.

### Perks of contributing

While there's no financial incentive to contribute (yet), you do still get a few perks that will be active for the duration of your service:

- Free premium account. This will grant you certain in-game benefits like additional characters.
- Additional member privileges. Contributors get access to in-game moderator privileges.
- Free `username@bastionofshadows.com` email address, which will be available for your personal use as well as official site business.

### Positions available

#### Frontend developer

The game currently has no frontend developers. I can do frontend work, but I really prefer the backend. Since there's no frontend yet, any frontend developer who joins will have a huge amount of say in how the frontend gets developed from the ground up.

A frontend developer should have experience building Single Page Applications, preferably in VueJS or React.

#### Designer

I'm not a designer. I have approximately zero creative bones in my body. Having someone who can design the site and maybe other things like a logo or graphics would really help a lot.

#### Storyteller

See my line about creativity under the Designer heading. The story of any game is going to be its greatest asset. Storytellers will have the ability to create quests, and they will also have access to an exclusive part of the member forum where they can discuss the future storyline of the main quests.
