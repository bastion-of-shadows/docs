Each playable class has a data sheet associated with it.

Once every 5 levels, each class grants one bonus point each to a class-specific Attribute and two class-specific Skills. This represents the natural bonuses one would expect as a character does class-based work day-in, day-out and develops their skills in those areas.

## Bounty Hunter

Bounty Hunters make their livings tracking down the wanted. Each bounty hunter has a personal credo to how they approach their work: Some prefer to bring their marks in alive, while others don't want to be bothered with live bounties, and yet others don't care as long as they get paid.
