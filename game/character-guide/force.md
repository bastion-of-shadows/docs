Some text-based RPGs will not allow players to guarantee the Force-sensitivity of their characters, but Bastion of Shadows takes a slightly different approach. Characters of the Jedi class are guaranteed to be Force-sensitive, but there are different Force Levels that a character may have.

On generation, Jedi characters are assigned a Force Level from `1-4`. Then, those characters will level-up their Force Level as their characters reach levels 15, 30, and 45. So a Level 45 Jedi may have a Force Level between 4 and 7, depending on what the character's initial random level was.

**NOTE**: For premium accounts, players may choose their starting Force Level.
