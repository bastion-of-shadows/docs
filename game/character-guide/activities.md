All activities in the game involve skill rolls. Skill rolls are usually compared to a difficulty value, which is determined with a variety of methods discussed here. If a skill roll meets or exceeds the difficulty value, the activity is considered successful.

## Difficulty Class

An activity's DC represents the base difficulty of that activity. Many low-level activities have a DC of 5, making it very easy to succeed in that activity. The DC is not the final difficulty of an activity; instead, it serves as a starting point for the difficulty. Some activities may only use the DC as the total difficulty, but many activities involve additional difficulty factors.

## Difficulty Modifiers

Some activities have modifiers added to that activity's DC that modify the difficulty of that activity. For example, running a blockade in a starship has a base DC of 25, but there is a modifier between `-5/+5` added to this base DC representing how many ships are in the blockade.

## Skill Pool

On the character side of an activity is the Skill Pool. The Skill Pool represents a character's maximum possible roll for success, and this changes for each character based on the activity. For example, the Breaking and Entering mission will involve a character's Dexterity attribute and Security skill. The Breaking and Entering Skill Pool is represented by a D20 roll (for the Skill Pool, this is represented by the real value `20`) plus that character's Dexterity modifier plus that character's Security skill

If the character's Skill Pool for an activity is less than that activity's total difficulty (DC + Modifiers) then the character cannot possibly succeed at that activity.

## Skill Roll

On the character side of an activity is the Skill Roll. The Skill Roll represents the character's attempt to complete an activity.
