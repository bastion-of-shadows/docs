Each character will have 18 points to spend on six Attributes. These Attributes are the basic building blocks of characters; each activity in the game will rely on at least one of these attributes. Because everyone has these personal attributes in some degree (no one has "zero constitution" or "zero intelligence"), each character starts with 4 points in each category.
