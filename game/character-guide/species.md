Each playable species has certain characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Here you can find more information about each of the playable species.

## Humans

Humans are one of the most populous species in the galaxy. They have an average similarity to many other species, but variation within humans is unusually high - unlike most other species, humans have a wide range of strengths that vary from individual to individual.

(Humans are the baseline species in the game. As such, all their stats are middled between the minimum value and maximum value.)

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | -           |
| HP Coefficient        | 10.0  | (baseline)  |
| Strength Modifier     | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Dexterity Modifier    | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Constitution Modifier | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Intelligence Modifier | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Charisma Modifier     | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Wisdom Modifier       | 0     | (baseline)  |
| Awareness Modifier    | 0     | (baseline)  |

## Twi'leks

Twi'leks are a species of multicolored humanoids from Ryloth. Their lekku house part of their brain and can be used for silent communication between Twi'leks. Ryl, the native language of Ryloth, cannot be correctly spoken by any other race because part of the language includes the posture and movement of the lekku.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 11.0  | Twi'leks need to be tough to survive on Ryloth |
| Strength Modifier     | -1    | Twi'leks live in squalor, and the few affluent tend to be fat rather than built |
| Dexterity Modifier    | 0     | Twi'leks aren't known to be particularly skilled with their hands or bodies (except dancing, obviously) |
| Constitution Modifier | 1     | Although Twi'leks are poor and malnourished, they have a hardy constitution that offsets these disadvantages |
| Intelligence Modifier | -1    | Twi'leks lack the means for interstellar travel. This indicates either a lack of advanced intelligence, or a level of destitution that lends itself to less intelligence |
| Charisma Modifier     | 2     | Twi'leks are known for their beauty and their utility as servants willing to please |
| Wisdom Modifier       | -1    | Twi'leks are known to make poor long-term decisions, most likely due to the squalor on their homeworld incentivizing short-term gains (e.g., Twi'leks rarely turn down food when offered, probably because food is so rare on Ryloth)  |
| Awareness Modifier    | 0     | Twi'leks don't have any special advantages from their lekku, which are used for communication and have no extrasensory abilities |

## Togrutas

Togrutas are a species of humanoids from Shili. They live in open, collectivist societies and work best in groups. There are many myths about the Togruta; some believe that Togruta are venomous, for example, and while the Togruta know about such myths, they let people believe the myths instead of correcting the record. Using the montrals on their head, they can echolocate around themselves in a 25 meter radius.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 11.5  | Togrutas are natural hunters, presumably tough |
| Strength Modifier     | 0     | Togrutas don't have any particular renown for their strength |
| Dexterity Modifier    | 1     | Togrutas are natural hunters capable of killing without weapons |
| Constitution Modifier | 0     | Togrutas appear to have a mix of strong and weak individuals |
| Intelligence Modifier | -1    | Togrutas advocate for social Darwinism and similar disadvantageous policies |
| Charisma Modifier     | -1    | Togrutas are known to let others believe untrue myths about themselves for their own benefit (such as the mistaken belief that Togrutas are venomous) |
| Wisdom Modifier       | 0     | Togrutas have behaviors and policies that are both beneficial (collectivist/communist) and detrimental (social Darwinism)  |
| Awareness Modifier    | 1     | Togrutas have montrals capable of echolocation-like spatial sensing |

## Wookiees

Wookies are a strong, fierce species of tree-dwellers from the planet Kashyyyk. They are intensely loyal to their people and their traditions, with a famous habit of swearing their life to someone who saves them from death. Because of their size, strength, and constitution, Wookiees are often sought after as slaves. Both the Galactic Empire and the Czerka Corporation have used Wookiees as low-cost labor against their will.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 12.5  | Wookiees are natural tanks |

| Intelligence Modifier | 1     | Wookiees make excellent mechanics and architects |
| Charisma Modifier     | -2    | Wookiees lack the ability to speak any language other than their own, and because many other species view Wookiees as barely-tamed beasts |
| Wisdom Modifier       | 0     | Wookiees are a simpler people with a simpler way of life |
| Awareness Modifier    | -1    | Wookiees have trouble seeing through the mat of fur surrounding their eyes (really, they just need balancing, so this is kind of contrived) |

## Kel Dors

The Kel Dors are most recognizable by the face mask and goggles that they must wear when away from their homeworld. Oxygen, nitrogen, and other common gasses are poisonous to Kel Dors. Their homeworld, Dorin, has a long tradition of its own Force-wielders known as the Baran Do Sages. The Baran Do Sages diminished when Dorin joined the Republic because the Jedi laid claim to their Force-sensitive younglings, but they didn't die out completely. Because they were relatively obscure during the Galactic Civil War, the Baran Do Sages survived Order 66 unscathed.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 9.5   | Kel Dors are roughly as tough as humans, although not quite |

| Awareness Modifier    | 1     | Kel Dors have extrasensory organs in their head |

## Gungans

Gungans are amphibious water-dwellers from the planet Naboo. Their cartilaginous skeleton allows them to contort their body in ways most land-dwellers could never accomplish. Most outsiders view Gungans as simple and primitive, but Gungans have actually developed advanced technologies and cultural traditions that are unique among the galaxy's peoples.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | Yes   | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 8.0   | Gungans are frail |
| Strength Modifier     | -1    | Gungans are generally weak, despite their strong legs |
| Dexterity Modifier    | 2     | Gungans are quite graceful and have excellent reflexes |
| Constitution Modifier | -1    | Gungans are frail and heavily reliant upon technology, but not -2 because they have certain resilient biological adaptations |

| Awareness Modifier    | 0     | Gungans are of average awareness |

## Droids

Droids are usually created for specific purposes: astromech droids service starships, protocol droids service guests, battle droids serve on the front lines. But every once in awhile, a droid is manufactured with a greater purpose in mind - or somehow acquires a greater purpose through a programming glitch or infrequent memory wipes.

### Stats

| Attribute             | Value | Explanation |
|-----------------------|-------|-------------|
| Force Sensitive       | No    | - |
| HP Coefficient        | 8.5   | Droids have limited actual durability - rather, units may upgrade their armor plating for additional protection |
| Strength Modifier     | 0     | Droids come in a wide range of strengths, with astromechs and protocol droids being weak and combat droids being stronger |
| Dexterity Modifier    | 1     | Droids have fine motor control abilities, but not 2 because droids still lack advanced mobility |
| Constitution Modifier | 1     | Droids are tougher than most meatbags, but not 2 because this is still highly variable between models |
| Intelligence Modifier | 1     | Droids have advanced intelligence - but again, there is high variability, and droid intelligence is typically narrow in scope |
| Charisma Modifier     | -1    | Droids are considered second-class by most of the galaxy; many droids lack a method to directly communicate with meatbags |
| Wisdom Modifier       | -2    | Droids lack the actualization and insight required to make truly wise decisions |
| Awareness Modifier    | 0     | Droid awareness varies widely depending on the design specs of the model |
