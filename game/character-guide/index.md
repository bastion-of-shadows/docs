Each player will have one character slot available to them. When premium accounts become available, they will have up to ten characters. (Those characters will be frozen in the event that an account downgrades from premium - only one character can be used at that point.)

## Descriptions

Each character will have a description that is fully customizable by the player. The player will be able to describe their character however they like - this will be a simple text field (probably with some sort of Markdown capabilities or something similar). There will be a photo gallery option as well, where players can add up to five images of their character. There will also be a field for a profile picture-style image of the character.
