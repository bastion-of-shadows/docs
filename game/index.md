Bastion of Shadows is a Star Wars-based RPG inspired by tabletop RPGs like D&D. The idea behind Bastion of Shadows is to create a persistent web-based universe in which players can develop their characters on solo quests or through group adventures with others.

Since the game isn't in active development yet, these docs are where the devs are planning the game itself. If you want to get in on the discussion - or contribute to the game's development - head over to [this site's GitHub repository](https://github.com/bastion-of-shadows/docs) and say hey!
